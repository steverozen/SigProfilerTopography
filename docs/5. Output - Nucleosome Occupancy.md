<h1> Nucleosome Occupancy </h1>

----------

The nucleosome occupancy analysis in this section was generated using the example data in [Quick Start Example][1] through SigProfilerTopography run without probability matrices.

## Nucleosome Occupancy Plots ##

In nucleosome occupancy plots, solid lines correspond to real somatic mutations, with blue solid lines reflecting SBSs, red solid lines reflecting DBSs, and green solid lines reflecting small IDs. Simulated somatic mutations are shown as dashed lines. Solid lines and dashed lines display the average nucleosome signal (y-axis) along a 2 kb window (x-axis) centered at the mutation start site for real and simulated mutations, respectively. The mutation site is annotated in the middle of each plot and denoted as 0. The 2 kb window encompasses 1,000 base pairs 5' adjacent to each mutation as well as 1,000 base pairs 3' adjacent to each mutation.
