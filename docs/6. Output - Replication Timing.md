<h1> Replication Timing </h1>

----------

The replication timing analysis in this section was generated using the example data in [Quick Start Example][1] through SigProfilerTopography run without probability matrices.

## Replication Timing Plots ##

Replication time data are separated into deciles, with each segment containing exactly 10% of the observed replication time signal (x-axis). Normalized mutation densities per decile (y-axis) are presented for early (left) to late (right) replication domains. Real data for SBS signatures are shown as blue bars, for DBS sig- natures as red bars, and for small ID signatures as green bars. Simulated somatic mutations are shown as dashed lines. 

[//]: # (TThe x-axis depicts the 10 bins from early to late replication regions, while the y-axis shows the normalized mutation density for each replication domain. The dashed line reflects the behavior of simulated mutations.)
