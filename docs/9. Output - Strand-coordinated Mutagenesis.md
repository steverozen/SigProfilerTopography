## Strand-coordinated Mutagenesis of SBS Signatures ##

Strand-coordinated mutagenesis of SBS signatures. Rows represent SBS signatures and columns reflect the lengths, in numbers of consecutive mutations, of strand-coordinated mutagenesis groups. SBS signatures with statistically significant strand-coordinated mutagenesis (adjusted p values % 0.05, z-test cor- rected for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg) are shown as circles under the respective group length with a minimum length of 5 consecutive mutations. The size of each circle reflects the number of consecutive mutation groups for the specified group length normalized for each signature. The color of each circle reflects the statistical significance of the number of subsequent mutation groups for each group length with respect to simulated mutations.
